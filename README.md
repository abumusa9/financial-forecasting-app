***Financial Forecasting LSTM Web Application***

**Project Overview**
This project delivers a professional-grade, interactive web application for financial forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. 
This application showcases advanced machine learning techniques, real-time data processing, and robust full-stack development practices. 

**Key Features**
• LSTM Neural Networks: Utilizes advanced LSTM models for accurate time series forecasting of stock prices.
• Real-time Data Ingestion: Integrates real-time market data streaming via WebSockets for up-to-date predictions.
• Uncertainty Quantification: Provides confidence intervals alongside predictions, offering a more comprehensive view of forecast reliability.
• Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly React-based frontend with dynamic charts and controls for exploring historical data, training models, and generating predictions.
• Model Evaluation: Allows users to evaluate trained models with key metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) directly within the dashboard.


**Technologies Used**

**Backend**:
• Python: Core programming language.
• Flask: Lightweight web framework for API and WebSocket handling.
• TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training LSTM models.
• Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and scaling.
• Flask-SocketIO: For real-time bidirectional communication.
• SQLAlchemy & SQLite: For database management and persistence.

**Frontend**:
• React: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
• Vite: Fast build tool for modern web projects.
• Recharts: Composable charting library for React.
• Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui: For responsive and aesthetically pleasing UI components.

**Deployment**:
• Docker: Containerization for consistent environments.
• Docker Compose: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
• AWS (Amazon Web Services)
